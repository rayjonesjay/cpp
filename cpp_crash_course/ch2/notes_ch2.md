####TYPES####
This chapter begins with a thorough discussion of fundamental types and then introduces user-defined types.
Also you will learn about control flow structures


#Fundamental types or primitive or built-in(they come with the programming language)
These are the most basic types of object and include:
>integer
>floating-point
>character
>Boolean
>byte
>size_t

Depending on how the  platform in which your code is running is implemented,
their (primitive types) features such as size and memory layout might be different.

int-> this types store whole numbers (numbers without a fractional component)

The four sizes of integer types are:
>short int 
>int 
>long int
>long long int

each can either be <signed> or <unsigned>

signed variable can be both positive or negative
unsigned MUST be a non-negative

integer types by default are signed and int
